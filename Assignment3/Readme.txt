I HAVE USED INTELLIJ IDE WITH JSOUP FOR WEB SCRAPPING AND APACHE POI FOR WRITTING FILE INTO XLSX FORMAT 

- ATTACHED JAR FILES WHICH ARE TO BE INCLUDED FOR SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAM.

- SCREENSHOTS ARE ALSO THERE FOR EVERY PROGRAM SEPARATELY ALONG WITH XLSX FORMAT OUTPUT FILE.

- IN QUES(D) PROGRAM ON THE CONSOLE IT WILL KEEP ON SHOWING "STILL RUNNING" (WHEN PROGRAM'S EXECUTION IS GOING ON).
  - WHEN IT WILL FINISH EXECUTION IT WILL SHOW NUMBER OF PDFs and NUMBER OF URLs STORED AND PARSED RESPECTIVELY.
